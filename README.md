## What is AWS EC2?
- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** allows users to run virtual servers (instances) in the cloud.  
- It provides scalable compute capacity for applications. EC2 allows you to:
  - Launch virtual servers (instances) with customizable configurations.
  - Scale resources as needed.
  - Pay for only the resources you use.

**Key Features**:
- **Scalable**: Easily scale up or down based on demand.
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for what you use.
- **Flexible**: Choose instance types that suit your needs (compute, memory, storage optimized).

---

## Why Use EC2?
**Benefits**:
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for what you use.
- **Highly Scalable**: Adjust resources based on traffic or application load.
- **Secure**: Built-in security with features like VPC, IAM, and encryption.
- **Reliable**: Built on AWS's global infrastructure with high availability.

---

## Key EC2 Components
1. **Instances**: Virtual servers that run your applications.
2. **Amazon Machine Images (AMI)**: Pre-configured images for EC2 instances.
3. **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**: Persistent storage for EC2 instances.
4. **Elastic IP**: Static public IP addresses.
5. **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls that control network access to your instances.

---

## EC2 Instance Types
EC2 offers several types of instances based on your use case:
- **General Purpose**: Balanced compute, memory, and networking (e.g., `t2.micro`, `t3.medium`).
- **Compute Optimized**: High CPU performance (e.g., `c5.large`).
- **Memory Optimized**: High RAM (e.g., `r5.xlarge`).
- **Storage Optimized**: High throughput for storage-heavy applications (e.g., `i3.2xlarge`).

---

## Launching an EC2 Instance
### Steps:
1. **Choose an AMI**: Select a base image (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu).
2. **Select Instance Type**: Pick the right size for your needs.
3. **Configure Instance**: Set network and subnet preferences.
4. **Add Storage**: Attach additional EBS volumes if needed.
5. **Configure Security Group**: Define rules for network access.
6. **Review and Launch**: Finalize your configuration and start the instance.

## EC2 Pricing Models
EC2 offers different pricing models:
- **On-Demand**: Pay per hour for compute capacity with no long-term commitment.
- **Reserved Instances**: Commit to a term (1 or 3 years) for discounted pricing.
- **Spot Instances**: Bid on unused EC2 capacity at lower prices.
- **Savings Plans**: Get flexible pricing for committing to a certain level of usage.

## EC2 Use Cases
- **Web Hosting**: Hosting websites and web apps with auto-scaling.
- **Application Hosting**: Running applications like databases, APIs, microservices.
- **Big Data**: Process large datasets in the cloud.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilize GPU instances for training models.

---

## Monitoring and Management of EC2
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitor EC2 performance (CPU usage, disk I/O).
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Track API calls and resource changes.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances.

## Security Best Practices
- **Use Security Groups**: Set inbound/outbound rules to control access.
- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhance security for IAM users.
- **Keep Systems Updated**: Regularly patch vulnerabilities.
- **Encrypt Data**: Use EBS encryption to secure sensitive data.

---

## EC2 Auto Scaling
- **Automatic Scaling**: Increase or decrease instances based on demand.
- **Scaling Policies**: Configure triggers to add/remove instances.
- **Health Checks**: Automatically replace unhealthy instances.

---

## EC2 Alternatives
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing for event-driven applications.
- **Amazon Lightsail**: Simple cloud hosting with pre-configured environments for smaller-scale applications.
